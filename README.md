This repository is to demonstrate my knowledge of SQL.

I learned a lot of SQL by reading "Sams Teach Yourself SQL" by Ben Forta. The code for the tables and values (which can be found online), found in this repository, are from the book. I am only using these tables to demonstrate my knowledge of querying relational tables, which I learned from Forta.
