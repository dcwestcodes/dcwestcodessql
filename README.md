This repository is to demonstrate my knowledge of SQL, which I hope to demonstrate in a coding interview.

I learned a lot of SQL by reading "Sams Teach Yourself SQL" by Ben Forta. The code for the tables and values (which can be found online), found in this repository, are from the book. I am only using these tables to demonstrate my knowledge of querying relational tables, which I learned from Forta. 

My queries were also from the book, and I am proud to say that I have answered many of the end-of-chapter questions correctly. I enjoyed this book alot and will always refer to it. Learning was made easy and fun!
